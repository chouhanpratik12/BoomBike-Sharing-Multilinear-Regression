# BoomBike-Sharing-Multilinear-Regression
## Problem Statement :
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know: a-Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes? b-How well those variables describe the bike demands ?

## Business Goal :
We need to build a model that explains the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables and to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. In future, the company, accordingly, can manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for the company management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Steps to follow :

- Clean the dataset (if needed)
- Visualising the data
- Data Preparation
- Splitting the data into Training and Testing dataset
- Building and Training Linear Models
- Residual Analysis of the Train Data
- Making Predictions using the Final model
- Evaluating the model
